# Django User Authentication

This Django project provides user authentication functionality, including user registration, login, and password hashing. It uses Django's built-in authentication system and provides simple views for signing up, logging in, and accessing the home page.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```
   pip install Django
```

2. Project Creation:

   ```
   django-admin startproject projectname
   ```

3. Run migrations:

   ```
   python manage.py migrate
   ```


4. App Creation:

   ```
   python manage.py appname yourapp
   ```


5. Create a superuser (optional):

   ```
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. Start the development server:

   ```
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

7. Access the application at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Usage

### Sign Up

- Access the sign-up page at [http://localhost:8000/signup](http://localhost:8000/signup)
- Enter your desired username, email, password, and confirm password
- Click the "Sign Up" button

### Log In

- Access the login page at [http://localhost:8000/login](http://localhost:8000/login)
- Enter your email and password
- Click the "Log In" button

### Home Page

- Once logged in, you will be redirected to the home page at [http://localhost:8000/home](http://localhost:8000/home)
- This page currently serves as a placeholder for the authenticated user's dashboard

## Implementation Details

- The project uses Django's `User` model for authentication and stores passwords securely using the `make_password` function from `django.contrib.auth.hashers`.
- Views are implemented for sign-up, login, and home pages, each rendering a corresponding HTML template.
- User input validation is performed to ensure data integrity and security.
- The project uses Django's built-in authentication system for user authentication and session management.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance the home page to display user-specific information or functionality.
- Implement password reset functionality.
- Improve user interface and user experience.
